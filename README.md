# Machine Learning Models - Linear & Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks and a dataset that demonstrate the implementation of **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** using **PySpark**.

- **Linear Regression** → Predicts the salary of employees in the Sales Department (Morning Session).  
- **Logistic Regression** → Predicts **job eligibility** based on GPA, Institute type, and Internship Experience.  
- **Dataset** → `job.csv`, used for training and testing logistic regression.
